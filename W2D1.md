## Topological Sort Video

- Given a directed, acyclic graph (DAG), sort all vertices from lower to higher order
- DFS wil help you with a topological sort
- Move through the vertices using DFS, then reverse, and you'll have the topological sort
- Great example: building a dependency graph
- Create a visited set and a sorted stack
- Visit children using DFS, putting them in the set
- If the children have no children / no more children, then put them in the stack 
- _Only_ possible for a directed, acyclic graph

```javascript
class Graph() {

    constructor() {
        this.numNodes = 0 //find a way to build this
    }

    topologicalSortHelper(vertex, visited, stack) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        for (let i = 0; i < vertex.children, i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                this.topologicalSortHelper(i, visited, stack);
            }
            stack.push(vertex);
        }
    }
    topologicalSort() {
        visited = {};
        stack = [];

        for (let j = 0; j < numNodes; j++) {
            //you would need an architecture that allows 
            //you to loop over the nodes like this
            if (!visited[j]) {
                this.topologicalSortHelper(j, visited, stack)
            }
        }
        //print stack in LIFO order to show ordered list
        for (k = 0; k < stack.length; k++) {
            console.log(stack[k]);
        }
    }

}
```

## Packets, Routers and Reliability

- Materials are not sent to you via direct, dedicated connections
- Information does not follow a fixed path when moving between two machines, especially when multiple packets are sent in the course of one conversation
- Packets in a message will be sent in various directions depending on the traffic that they encounter 
- The packets might not arrive in the sent order, but they need to be correctly reassembled 
- Packets contain information about where they're coming from, and where they're heading 
- Every router will keep track of multiple possible paths for delivering a packet 
- Often, the best route is not necessarily the more direct
- Multiple path options makes the internet fault-tolerant, delivery packets even when particular machines are down
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the guaranteed mail service of the Internet, ensuring that all needed packets have been received 
- Without a full receipt, TCP will not allow the assembly of packets / program to run 

## TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) and related Techquickie Videos

- Online data needs to know where it's going 
- Layers of TCP: application layer (HTTP/SFTP), transport layer (TCP / UDP), internet layer (IP layer)
- Application layer and transport layer speak using ports on your computer 
- TCP distributes the sent information to another computer with the correct address and specified ordering 
- Internet layer sends TCP over to a specified IP address
- TCP / IP can deal with packets from all of you computer's applications so that your computer's programs doesn't need to design that itself 
- IP address will only get you as far as the modem that you have in your house
- Each device has a MAC address (media access control) will specify your adress, controlled by the final layer of TCP / IP
- ISPs use MAC address to control internet delivery to your specific devices in your home 
- IP dictates the way that headers are written to deliver packets, and also the path defined for moving the packet through space 
- IPv4 has only received minor changes from its original creation in the 1970s 
- IPv4 only allows for 4 billion unique addresses (we were reusing IP addresses for years)
- IPv6 allows trillions of trillions of unique addresses
 -IPv6 allows for auto-configuration for easier communication with other devices
