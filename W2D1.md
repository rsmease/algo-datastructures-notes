## Topological Sort Video

- Given a directed, acyclic graph (DAG), sort all vertices from lower to higher order
- DFS wil help you with a topological sort
- Move through the vertices using DFS, then reverse, and you'll have the topological sort
- Great example: building a dependency graph
- Create a visited set and a sorted stack
- Visit children using DFS, putting them in the set
- If the children have no children / no more children, then put them in the stack 
- _Only_ possible for a directed, acyclic graph

```javascript
class Graph() {

    constructor() {
        this.numNodes = 0 //find a way to build this
    }

    topologicalSortHelper(vertex, visited, stack) {
        visited[vertex] = true;
        for (let i = 0; i < vertex.children, i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                this.topologicalSortHelper(i, visited, stack);
            }
            stack.push(vertex);
        }
    }
    topologicalSort() {
        visited = {};
        stack = [];

        for (let j = 0; j < numNodes; j++) {
            //you would need an architecture that allows 
            //you to loop over the nodes like this
            if (!visited[j]) {
                this.topologicalSortHelper(j, visited, stack)
            }
        }
        //print stack in LIFO order to show ordered list
        for (k = 0; k < stack.length; k++) {
            console.log(stack[k]);
        }
    }

}
```

## Packets, Routers and Reliability

- Materials are not sent to you via direct, dedicated connections
- Information does not follow a fixed path when moving between two machines, especially when multiple packets are sent in the course of one conversation
- Packets in a message will be sent in various directions depending on the traffic that they encounter 
- The packets might not arrive in the sent order, but they need to be correctly reassembled 
- Packets contain information about where they're coming from, and where they're heading 
- Every router will keep track of multiple possible paths for delivering a packet 
- Often, the best route is not necessarily the more direct
- Multiple path options makes the internet fault-tolerant, delivery packets even when particular machines are down
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the guaranteed mail service of the Internet, ensuring that all needed packets have been received 
- Without a full receipt, TCP will not allow the assembly of packets / program to run 

## TCP / IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) and related Techquickie Videos

- Online data needs to know where it's going 
- Layers of TCP: application layer (HTTP/SFTP), transport layer (TCP / UDP), internet layer (IP layer)
- Application layer and transport layer speak using ports on your computer 
- TCP distributes the sent information to another computer with the correct address and specified ordering 
- Internet layer sends TCP over to a specified IP address
- TCP / IP can deal with packets from all of you computer's applications so that your computer's programs doesn't need to design that itself 
- IP address will only get you as far as the modem that you have in your house
- Each device has a MAC address (media access control) will specify your adress, controlled by the final layer of TCP / IP
- ISPs use MAC address to control internet delivery to your specific devices in your home 
- IP dictates the way that headers are written to deliver packets, and also the path defined for moving the packet through space 
- IPv4 has only received minor changes from its original creation in the 1970s 
- IPv4 only allows for 4 billion unique addresses (we were reusing IP addresses for years)
- IPv6 allows trillions of trillions of unique addresses
 -IPv6 allows for auto-configuration for easier communication with other devices 

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Works on both directed and undirected graphs
- Basic pseudo code
    - Find the cheapest node
    - Update the costs of the immediate neighbors of this node
    - Repeat steps 1-2 until you've done this for every node
    - REturn the lowest cost to each node, and the optimal path to do so
- NOTE: rather than continuing to take notes on this, I just built a version of it and put it in the javascript-misc folder, along with an implementation of a priority queue 

### Pseudo code:
```javascript

const graph = {
    start: {A: 5, B: 2},
    A: {C: 4, D: 2},
    B: {A: 8, D: 7},
    C: {D: 6, finish: 3},
    finish: {}
};

const costs = {
    A: 5,
    B: 2,
    finish: null
}

const parents = {
    A: 'start'
    B: 'start'
    finish: null
}

const processed = ['start', 'A', 'B']

const lowestCostNode = (costs, processed) => {
    return Object.keys(costs).reduce((lowest, node) => {
        if (lowest = null || costs[node] < costs[lowest] {
            if (!processed.includes(node)) {
                lowest = node;
            }
        })
        return lowest;
    }, null)
};

const dijkstra = (graph) => {
    const costs = Object.assign({finish: null}, graph.start);
    const parents = {finish: null};

    for (let child in graph.start) {
        parents[child] = 'start';
    };
    const processed = [];

    let node = lowestCostNode(costs, processed);
    while (node) {
        let cost = costs[node];
        let children = graph[node];
        for (let n in children) {
            let newCost = cost + children[n];
            if (!costs[n]) {
                costs[n] = newCost;
                parents[n] = node;
            }
            if (costs[n] > newCost) {
                costs[n] = newCost;
                parents[n] = node;
            }
        }
        processed.push(node);
        node = lowestCostNode(costs, processed)
    }

    let optimalPath = ['finish'];
    let parents = parents.finish;

    while (parent) {
        optimalPath.push(parent);
        parent = parents[parent];

        optimalPath.reverse();

        const results = {
            distance: costs.finish,
            path: optimalPath
        }

        return results;
    }
}

## TCP vs UDP

- We need transport protocols to help us pass things around on the internet in a reliable manner
- All packets have five layers: application, transport, network, link and physical 
    - UDP and TCP are part of the transport layer
- Multiple applications can use one connection simultaneously by communicating through unique ports on your device 
- Messages are wrapped in segments that contain port information and then added to a packet's transport layer
    - These segments are unwrapped when they arrive at the destination machine 
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    - Advantage: smaller header, 8 bytes vs. TCPs 20 bytes 
    - No connection to create an maintain
    - More control when the data are sent out 
    - When UDP detects corruption, it either discards it or tries to use it with a warning
    - When a packet is lost, it does not call for a new copy to be sent 
    - There is no congestion control in UDP
    - UDP does not guarantee that your packets will arrive in order 
    - Lightweight, but not that reliable 
- TCP (Transmisson Control Protocol)
    - Connection based: we have to do the three-way handshake: want to set up a connection? yes, I do. Do you hear me saying yet? Yes, I hear you saying yes
    - Delivery acknowledgments afforded by the fact that segmets wrapping your packets include a transmission number 
    - Segment numbering allows for in-order delivery guarantee
    - TCP has congestion control, allowing for delayed transmission when the network is congested to avoid packet mistakes 
    - You don't always want TCP's benefits 
        - If you're having a real-time conversation, TCP will deliberately introduct latency
        - Bigger overhead, slower administration 
        - Video streaming learns how to deal with packet loss 
    - UDP is message-oriented, sending data in distinct chunks
    - TCP is steam-oriented, sending a continuous flow of data that is in bigger or smaller chunks based on the current needs and network load 
        - Things are just sorted when they arrive at the right machine 
- Do I want TCP ro UDP?
    - Texts: I probably want TCP, because precise speed doesn't matter, but ordering does 
    - File transfers: I probably want TCP because a scrambled or undelivered JPEG would be awful
    - Multimedia: UDP has less latency and overhead, and we can handle some packet loss
        - Now trending toward TCP 
    - Small transactions like DNS lookups: UDP, for its speed

## OSI Model

- Theoretical stack of seven layers to understand how networks operate
- Allows for multivendor standardization 
- We use the TCP / IP model in the current internet, because it has everything that the Internet currently needs 
- Layer 1: Physical Layer
    - Carry the data across physical hardware
- Layer 2: Data Link
    - MAC Address, Switches
- Layer 3: Network
    - IP address, Routers
- Layer 4: Transport
    - TCP, UDP, port numbers 
- Layer 5: Session
    - Create and terminate sessions between devices
- Layer 6: Presentation
    - Format Data, Encryption
- Layer 7: Application 
    - SMTP, FTP, Telnet, where the application and end user communicate
- Mnemonic: All People Seem To Need Data Processign (APSTNDP)
- The receiving device will process the layers Physical -> Application, but the sending device will assemble them Application -> Physical 

## Review of 'This' Keyword

- the context-reference 'this' keyword in JavaScript is not bound
- the value of 'this' is evaluated at runtime
- rules that set this do not look at object literals, only execution contexts

## React Review

- React component is a basic JS function that returns a element that gets parsed as HTML by the browser's DOM
- Component names start with a capital letter, as lowercase names are reserved for HTML elements
- React.createElement accepts a dynamic number of arguments, representing the children of the first argumejt, actually creating a tree
- We can mix HTML elements with Javascript React elements in JSX
- You can interpolate raw JS anywhere in JS with {}
- React components can be written as JS classes, with more detailed features and function calls that create element behavior 

## Most Common HTTP Statuses

- 200 OK
    - Request succeeded; your response was returned and here it is!
- 300 Multiple Choices
    - There are more than one options for you to pick from; send a more specific request
- 301 Moved Permanently
    - Resource has been assigned to a new permanent URI; look there instead
- 302 Found
    - Here's your stuff, but this was temporarily moved to another URI. Look for it here when you search next time, though
- 304 Not Modified
    - You already asked for this and I haven't updated anything here since the last time that you asked. I won't send it again; just use what you have 
- 307 Temporary Redirect
    - Here's your stuff, but this was temporarily moved to another URI. Look for it here when you search next time, though
- 400 Bad Request
    - You have a typo in your request; fix it and send me a valid request
- 401 Unauthorized
    - The request requiers user authentication. You didn't say the magic word. You just include a WWW-authentication header field with relevant authentiction credentials
- 403 Forbidden
    - I understand your request, but I refused to send you anything. You cannot say a magic word to chance my mind. These resources are not something that I can send over the network
- 404 Not Found
    - Your syntax is valid, but I do not have anything at that location; I might have something here later, but not now
- 410 Gone
    - I used to have something here, but no longer; if you can, remove links to this page
    - I know that I will never put something here again
- 500 Internal Server Error
    - The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request
- 501 Not Implemented
    - The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill th request (that method is not supported)
- 503 Service Unavailable
    - Server crash, server maintenance, server overload, server maliciously being attacked, website has overused its bandwith
- 550 Permission Denied
    - Your current user authentication forbids you from accesing this action
