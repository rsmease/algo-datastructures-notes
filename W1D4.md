## Geeks for Geeks: BFS for Graphs 

- Similar to trees, except that graphs may be cyclic
- Just like with DFS, we need a boolean visitedTracker object or array to determine whether or not we've already seen a child node

```javascript

    const visitedTracker = {};
    const process = function(vertex) { 
        //do something to vertex
        } 
    const graphBFS = function(startingVertex, visitedTracker) {
        const queue = [];
        queue.push(startingVertex)
        visitedTracker[startingVertex] = true;


        while (queue.length) {
            let currentVertex = queue.unshift();
            process(currentVertex);
            currentVertex.children.forEach(function(child) {
                if (!visitedTracker[child]) {
                    visitedTracker[child] = true;
                    queue.push(child);
                }
            }
                
        }
    }
```

## The Domain Name System

- Internet Assigned Number Authority assigns IP addresses 
- ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) are groups that work with IANA
- ICANN promotes what's called a mutli-stakeholder model of ownership for the internet
- In theory, everyone has a voice with ICANN, although in practice, the telecoms tend to hold more sway
- Service providers (Google, Facebook) tend to advocate for user privacy, but also for a flat internet that protect their monopoly

## React Lifecycle Methods 

### componentWillMount

- Called before render()
- You shouldn't use componentWillMount() to make asynchronous calls to your backend
- The most common use case is configuring your app when the root component mounts
- Don't call setState here 

### componentDidMount

- You want to put a AJAX request here because you can't be certain that the request won't be completed before the component renders (so don't use willMount)
- Add event listeners here
- Draw on a canvas element that you rendered here 

### componentWillReceiveProps

- check the props that will change
- if the props change in a significant way, respond to the change in props to trigger a state transition for this local component
- this method is not called when your component first mounts 

### shouldComponentUpdate

- This will alway be a boolean
- Allows you to control when you want the component to update (you don't always want this)
- 'Only update the component if the props that I care about change'

### componentWillUpdate

- the same as componentWillReceiveProps, except that you can't call setState

### componentDidUpdate

- a variation on componentWillReceiveProps
- no granular control about when to update and in response to which prop changes
- only use when you want this to be run regardless of which props are changing 

### componentWillUnmount 

- cancel any outgoing network requests 
- clean up any after effects of your component mounting
