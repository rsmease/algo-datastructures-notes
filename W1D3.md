## Trees, Heaps, Tries and Graphs (Cracking the Coding Interview)

- A tree is a data structure composed of nodes
- Each tree has a root node
- The root node has zero or more child nodes
- Each child node has zero or more child nodes, etc 
- A tree is typically an acyclic digraph, where children do not have a referene to the location of their parent 
- A binary tree is a tree i which each node has up to two children
- Binary trees are not the b-all end all of trees, but they are well known because of their quick lookup time (O logN), which make them useful for, e.g. an adjacency list used to search the edges in a graph 
- A binary search tree is one where the left children are strictly less than the right children throughout the graph, not just at a particular layer of the tree 
- When asked a tree, question, it is wise to enforce a strict understanding of which type of tree the interview wants to work with 
- Trees may be balanced, but not all trees are balanced 
- A balanced tree is one where the left/right distribution is rougly similar (it does not haves to be strictly even throughout the tree for the three to be balanced; cf. a dense vs sparse graph... it's a spectrum)
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree where all levels are filled except the lowermost leaf level
    - If the lowest level is filled, it must be filled left to right for the tree to be considered complete 
- A full binary tree is a tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children
- A perfect binary tree is one that is both full and complete (there won't be any left-only child nodes in the lowermost level)

### Tree Traversal Types: 

#### In-Order Traversal: Left, Parent, Right:

```javascript
const inOrderTraversal(node) {
    if (node !== null) {
        inOrderTraversal(node.left);
        visit(node);
        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
    }
}
```

### Pre-Order Traversal: Parent, Left, Right:

```javascript
const inOrderTraversal(node) {
    if (node !== null) {
        visit(node);
        inOrderTraversal(node.left);
        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
    }
}
```

### Post-Order Traversal: Left, Right, Parent:

```javascript
const inOrderTraversal(node) {
    if (node !== null) {
        visit(node);
        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
        inOrderTraversal(node.left);
    }
}
```

### Heaps 

- A min-heap is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller than its children
- The root is the minimum element in the tree 
- A max-heap is, of course, the opposite 
- There are two key operations in a heap: insert() and findMax(), findMin()
- To insert into a heap, we place the new elements at the leaf level and then bubble it up the tree by swapping it with its parents until we find its appropriate position (it is greater than its parent but smaller than both of its children)
- In a min/max heap, there is no inherit ordering between the left and right child nodes, except that they are always larger than their parent 

### Tries  (Prefix Trees)

- Tries are an n-ary where (n is number of letters in an alphabet) tree used to denote the construction of strings that represent real words
- Tries that terminate in a null node are a chain of letters that prefix and then ultimately form a complete word 
- Both a trie and a hash table would have a lookup time of O(len(word)) for a word, because even the hash table has to scan the entire word before looking it up

### Graphs

- A tree is an acyclic graph
- In general, a graph is a collection of nodes with edges (conections) between the nodes 
- Graphs can be directed (relationships are not necessarily mutual, e.g. a map of flights) or undirected (relationships are necessarily mutual, e.g. facebook friendships)
- If there is a path between all vertices in a graph, it's connected
- If there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex, we say that it's strongly connected
- The two common ways to search a graph and DFS and BFS 
    - Depth-first search starts at the root and explores every branch completely before moving on to the next branch (we consider the first sibling's children before considering its siblings)
    - Breadth-first search, typically invokes with a queue to hold the proper order of processing each nodes, explores all siblings of a given node before reviewing, in left-to-right order, their first generation of children (and then, left-to-right, that generation's children)
- Generally speaking, we prefer DFS when we want to search every node, but we prefer BFS when we think that our given target is somewhere near the root
- In-order, pre-order and post-order traversal are all forms of DFS
- BFS, unlike DFS, is not a recursive traversal 

```javascript 
    const breadthFirstTraversal(parent) {
        let queue = [];
        parent.marked = true
        queue.push(parent);

        while (queue.length) {
            let current = queue.unshift();
            current.children.forEach(child => {
                if (!child.marked) {
                    child.marked = true;
                    queue.push(child);
                }
            })
        }
    }
```
- Bidrectional search is used to find the shortest path between a source and a destination node
    - You basically run a BFS from each node; when they collide, you've found the path
    - In a traditional search, we would be looking at up to childrenPerNode^depth nodes, but with a bidirectional search, we are looking at up to childrenPerNode^depth/2, which is a huge improvement

## What happens when you visit Google?

- Part 1: Finding the IP address
    - Your browser checks its own cache for the DNS record of the site
    - Every site has its own DNS address; you can use this address to visit the site instead of its human-friendly name
    - If the browser can't find it, it checks the OS cahce
    - If the OS cache doesn't have it, the browser submits a request to the router's cache
    - If the router doesn't have it, it check with the ISP, moving through DNS servers until it locates the correct DNS record 
    - We cache data to reduce network loads for common addresses 
    - Servers that return IP addresses are called name servers 
    - With something that has a third-level domain, like maps.google.com, the DNS will first route to the name server for the main domain, google.com, and this server will route to the third-level name server that stores the correct IP address 
- Part 2: The TCP connection
    - The TCP/IP protocol is a three-way handshake
    - The client and server exchange SYN and ACK messages to establish a connection
    - The client sends a SYNchronize packet to the server asking if it will open a conection
    - The server, if it has open ports, will respond with an ACKnowlege message
    - The client will receive teh SYN/ACK packet and send back an ACKnowledgement that it has receive teh SYN/ACK
    - The connection is live 
- Part 3: The browser sends an HTTP request 
    - Browsers will start with a GET request for the page 
    - This request will also contain additional information such as a browser ID header (user-agent header), an acceptable response types header (accept header) and connection headers to keep the TCP connection alive 
    - E.G.
        - GET: web address
        - Accept: image/jpeg, application/xaml+xml
        - User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
        - Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
        - Connection: Keep-Alive
        - Host: facebook.com
        - Cookie: cookieID#
-Part 4: The Web Server Responds
    - A web server at the IP address receives the request and passes it to a request handler (controller)
    - It assembles the response in a particular format, commonly JSON
    - E.G.
        - HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        - Cache-Control: private, no-store, no-cache
        - Expires: some date
        - P3P: privacy intentions
        - Pragma: no-cache
        - Content-Encoding: gzip
        - Content-Type: text/html, charset=utf-8
        - X-Cnection: close
        - Transfer-Encoding: chunked
        - Date: some date
-Part 5: The Browser displays the response
    - Typically, this is HTML or JSON delivered to client side HTML (e.g. in React)

## Geeks for Geeks: DFS for Graphs

- DFS for graphs is similar, except that we have to consider that graphs may be cyclic

```javascript

    const visitedTracker = {};
    const process = function(vertex) { 
        //do something to vertex
        } 
    const graphDFS = function(vertex, visitedTracker) {
        if (!visitedTracker[vertex]) {
            process(vertex);
            visitedTracker[vertex] = true;
            vertex.children.forEach(child =>
                graphDFS(child, visitedTracker)
            );
        };
    }
```

- OK, but what if the graph is disconnected? How do we process the orphaned nodes? 
    - We need a way to make sure that we iterate over all the nodes (more expensive, because it will basically force us to reexamine a few already visited nodes, confirm that we've visited them, and then move on)

## DFS / BFS Video

### DFS
- Take the first element, add it to the visited array
- Review the element's first sibling and push them onto the stack, then the first sibling's first sibling, until you reach a sibling with only the one, previously visited sibling, and then remove them off the stack and look at their one siblings's next sibling, if any (moving up the stack as necessary)
- When moving back up the stack, check first if a sibling node has been visited or not

### BFS

- The main difference here is the use of a queue 
- We add all the sibling nodes of a given node to the queue and after marking it as a visited node
- We then move on to the next element of the queue, add its siblings to the end of teh queue, and so on
- BFS search is best when you expect that the result you're looking for will be somewhere near the origin node, with respect to degrees of relation
- When moving along the queue, especially towards the end, you'll end up looking again at a lot of already visited nodes, but you will pass over them because they are marked as boolean true in your visited tracker array

## 'What the Heck is the Event Loop?' Video

- V8 has a heap that stores memory allocation and a stack of execution contexts 
- Things like setTimeout and the DOM are really webAPIs that are built to interact with the V8 engine, but which are not present in the engine itself
- JS is single-threaded, meaning that it has a single stack of execution contexts, which runs in order 
- The call stack is a stack that tells us where we are when we're calling a bunch of functiosn in a row (useful when we have asynchronous functions)
- When we run synchronous functions, they freeze the stack 
- Asynchronous functions allow us to call a function later on while continuing to run available scripts that users can interact with in real time
- Where does an asychronous call go if it's asynchroous (it's not on the stack)
    - This is where the event loop (a queue) comes into play
- The WebAPI doesn't just force the asynchronous function back onto your stack, it instead passes it to the event queue
- The event loop (queue) will wait for your stack to be empty and then push out the tasks in FIFO order
- The render function has to wait for the stack to clear, but the render is also run before the events in the queue 

## JavaScript Handbook

### Types and Coercion

- Seven types in ES6: null, undefined, boolean, number, string, object and symbol
    - These are all primitives, except object
- Undefined is the absence of declaration; null is the absence of assignment 
- JS engages in a lot of type coercion, most commonly converting number strings to numbers and falsey values to boolean false 
- The '+' operator will coerce numbers to string and strings to numbers, but the other matematical operators will only turn strings into numbers or return NaN
- == checks for equality with coercion, whereas === checks for strick equality without coercion
- comparison '0' == false will return true because booleans compred with non-booleans are coerce to a number, so you will then have '0' == 0 which will return true

### Value vs. Reference 

- Simple values are always assigned by value-copy
- Non-primitives create a copy of the reference when assigned
    - Non-primitives, when a variable is assigned to them, pass a referene to their value rather than a copy
    - Non-primitives are threfore mutated if one of these referent copies is mutated 
    - Non-promitive values are equal by references (e.g. two arrays are equal if they refer to the same array in memory, but not because they are the same array)

```javascript 
    let a = 3;
    let b = a;
    b++;
    // b is now 3, but a is still 2;

    let a = [1]
    let b = a;
    b.push(2);
    let c = [1, 2]

    //a and b are now both [1,2]
    a == b //true only due to reference
    b == c //false due to how JS compares arrays
```

### Scope 

- Scope defines the accessible variables in a given context
- Global scsope is the outermost scope
- Local scope is scope nested within a closure of some kind, which enables private variables that are unavailable to the outer scope 

### Hoisting 

- Moving declarations (not assignments) to the top of their scopes 
- Remember that let and const are block scoped, whereas var is globally scoped 

### Function Expression vs. Declaration 

- Function expressions are assignments to variables; their assignment is not hoisted, although the variable declaration will be hoisted 
- Function declaration (function name()...) is hoisted 

### Variables: var, let, const 

- All three variables are function-scoped when called within an enclosing function 
- Variables defined in a block scope are available throughout the block
- An undeclared variable (assignment without var, let or const) creates a var declaration on the global object 
- Let and const are _not_ hoisted, even in their block context

```javascript
if (someCondition) {
    console.log(test) // ReferenceError
    console.log(anotherTest) //undefined
    let test = 4;
    var anotherTest = 5;
}
```
- Also, remember that const is not immutable, it just can't be reassigned 

### Immediately Invoke Function Expression (IIFE)

- Called immediately when defined 
- Surrounding parentheses are used to prevent the program from seeing it as a function declaration 
- Enables you to attach private data to a function, and it avoids polluting the global namespace
- Declaration version is compatible; the defintion is not
    - You can make a function definition work as an IIFE by wrapping it in parentheses

### Context 

- Often confused with scope, but context is determinant of how a function should be invoked 
- Scope refers to the visibility of variables 
- Context can be said to include a scope, but scope and context are not properly identical 

### Function Calls: call, apply and bind 

- .call() invokes the function immediately and rquires you to pass in arguments individually, one by one (remember call for comma separated values)
- .apply() invokes a function immediately and allows you to pass in arguments as an array (remember array ~= apply)
- If you pass an array to call, it will treat the entire array as a single parameter
    - We can get arround this with array destructuring in ES6
- .bind() returns a new function, with a certain context and parameters 
- .bind() works like the call function, requiring comma separated values (remember: bind and call both have four letters)

### This keyword 

- Understanding the context of this can be very complicated at times 
- The value of this will be determined by the function's execution context, unless the function is bound to some other context 
- The order of binding: 
    - Constructor: Generation of a this with a 'new' keyword, invoking a constructor that produces the this
    - Explicit: Generation of a this with a call to .bind() in some previous context 
    - Implicit: When a function is called within a context, it implicitly receives the this that encapsulates that context (a function, an object, etc.)
    - Default: the global object or window is this 
        - Default binding also happens when a function is invoked within a function, without explicit binding, within the context of the inner function
    - Lexical this: this of the surrounding scope when an arrow function is created, offering explicit binding without .bind()

### Strict Mode 

- Benefits of strict mode: 
    - Makes debugging easier, by reducing the number of silent errors
    - prevents accidental global variables by throwing errors
    - prevents invalid use of delete by throwing errors
    - prevents duplicate property names, parameter values 
    - make eval() safer by make sure that variables created within eval are not hoisted beyond the scope of eval()
    - referencing a 'this' value of null does not coerce to the global object 

### 'new' Keyword 

- Creates a new object, sets the object's prototype to the prototype of the constructor function 
- Executes the constructor function with 'this' as the newly created object
- Returns the created object, along with the return value of the constructor and its accompanying key-value pairs for use 

### Prototype and Inheritance

- Each object has a prototype object, from which it inherits in all of its prototype's properties 
- '__proto__' is a non-standard mechanism for retrieving the prototuype of an object
- All normal objects also inherit a .constructor property that points to a constructor function for the object
- The '__proto__' property links that object to the .prototype property of he constructor function when the constructor function is invoked 
- When referencing a property of an object, the JS engine will first check the object, when the object's prototype, etc.
    - This could go all the way up to the Object, which has a .prototype of null, so the call will then return undefined
- Object.create(obj) creates a new object with the .prototype of obj
- An inherited property is a copy by refrence of the property stored somewhere in the prototypal chain 
- Mutations to the inherited property are passed down the chain, but if the inherited property is replaced, that change will not be passed down the chain
- In classical inheritance, objects inherit from special classes, whereas in prototypal inheritance, they just inherit directly from other objects 
- There are three types of prototypal inheritance: 
    - Prototype delegation: inheritance is mediated through a reference to a prototype's properties
    - Concatenative delegation: inheritance is mediated by copying each of a prototype's properties
    - Functional inheritance: inheritance is mediated by a constructor function
