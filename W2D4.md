## Dynamic Programming Review

### Overlapping Subproblems

- Dynamic programming is an algorithmic paradigm the solves a problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation
- Two core properties: overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure 
- Similar to divide and conquer (e.g. mergesort)
- Computed subproblems are stored in a table or structure to prevent recomputation
    - Not all kinds of problems lend themselves to this approach; e.g. a binary search traversal doesn't have this kind of problem, but a directed graph search would
    - Computer the fibonnaci sequence or testing whether or gathing prime numbers would also present a problem that has overlapping subproblems
- There are two ways to store subproblems: memoization and tabulation
    - A memoized program for a problem is similar to what we see in small recusive problem memoizations that reduce runtime
    - We initialize a lookup array and check it whenever we need a solution to a subproblem
    - With a tabulated problem, we build all the subproblems every time, first starting with our base case and then working our way to the final result

#### Fibonacci with Memoization
```javascript

const dynamicFibonacci = function(bound, seenNumbers = []) {
    if (n < 0 || typeof n !== 'number') {
        raise new Error("The fibonacci sequence is not valid for this input.")
    } else if (n < 2) {
        seenNumbers[n] = n;
    }

    if (!seenNumbers[n]) {
        seenNumbers[n] = dynamicFibonacci(n-1, seenNumbers) + dynamcFibonacci(n-2, seenNumbers);
    }
    return seenNumbers[n];
}

```

#### Fibonacci with Tabulation
```javascript

const dynamicFibonacci2 = function(bound, seenNumbers = [0, 1]) {
    for (let i = 2; i < bound; i++) {
        seenNumbers[i] = seenNumbers[i-1] + seenNumbers[i-2];
    }
    return seenNumbers[-1];
}

```

### Optimal Substructure

- An opitalm substructure exists if an optimal solution can bes constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
- Typically, we would use a greedy algorithm, _not_ a dynamic programming algorithm, if we know that we can induce the optimal path without pulling all the levers, so to speak
    - This is the magic of Dijsktra's algorithm
    - This does not mean that optimal substructures are not useful for dynamic programming
- In the absence of an optimal substructure, dynamic programming approaches to the remaining 'solution space' are the best way forward
- Optimal substructure is useful for dynamic programming because it demonstrates that we can resolve a dynamic programming problem using subproblems 
    - It points out the validity for an inductive reasoning inherent in the approach of the algorithm 

## Session, Storage and Cookies

### localStorage and sessionStorage

- relatively new APIs and are nearly identical
- sessionStorage is only available for one browser session
- localStorage survives multiple sessions
- these are perfect for persisting non-sensitive user data (preferences, scores in games)
- only allow you to store strings 
- new to HTML5; cookies are much older
- Both are stored only on the browser
- localStorage contents can be viewed in the Application tab of the Chrome developer tools
- sessionStorage will receive localStorage unless it's ovewritten with something more specific
- storage is part of the window API (window.localStorage)

### Cookies

- cookies can be tampered with, so session is your only real option for storing sensitive data
- If you are not using SSL, cookie information can also be intercepted in transit, especially on public WiFi
- Cookies have a degree of protection from security risks like cross-site scripting and JavaScript injection
- If you have a copy of a cookie, for all intents and purposes you become that user
    - You can access that user's data
- All cookies valid for a page are sent from teh browser to the server for every request to the same domain
- Browsers may limit the size of data that can be stored in cookies
- Typically, cookies are used to store ID tokens for authetication, session and ad tracking 
    - They are typically not human-readable
- Cookie expiry is manually managed 
    - This is how cookies are deleted
    - Cookies are expired by adding an expiration date in the past and identifying the path where the cookie should be deleted 
- Stored on browser and server
- Cookies are sent with every request, whereas localStorage and sessionStorage are only received and then never sent by cookies
- Cookies are part of the document API (document.cookie)
    - Cookies can be associated with specific paths on your website
- All cookies are stored in one string file


### Session

- Session is typically the safest place for sensitive storage becaues it is housed entirely in the client's unit
- Session data must expire after a given time to avoid all server resources being taken up by abandoned sessions
- When using session data, remember that it expires
    - This is especially important with e.g. long forms that the user is likely to abandon
- Some developers use hidden HTML inputs to persist data from one page of a form to anothe to avoid session expiry

## Event Delegation 

- If you attach an event listener to a DOM element, it's also attached to all of its children (because they will bubble to it when clicked, or sooner if the listener is set to react to event capturing)
