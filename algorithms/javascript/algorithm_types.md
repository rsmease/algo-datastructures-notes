Greedy Algorithms

Technique for resolving a problem where we always look to approach the data in the way that seems like it will lead to the solution as quickly as possible.

Advantage: predicting runtimes are easier
Disadvantage: proving correctness or optimality is more difficult

Greedy algorithms work best when:
  - you have specific criteria that you need to use to make decisions.
  - the problem has subproblems that can be optimized
  - your problem has a greedy property (hard to prove)——there are some problems that seem more valuable to solve first
