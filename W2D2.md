## HTTP vs HTTPS

- Think of all Internet activity for what it is: sending and receiving messages from a server
- Symmetric key crytography: e.g. Caesar cipher, where knowing the encryption pattern also lets you infer the decryption pattern
- Man in the Middle attack: interception of the key mid-transfer, allowing a third party to decryt messages sent using this key
- Asymmetric key cryptography: the send of the message is not given the key to decrypt, they are merely given a way to enter a message in an encrypted space
    - The sender of the messages has a public key to open the box
    - The receiver of the the messages has a private key that is never distributed 
- Asymmetric patterns are certified by a Certification Authority, which allow the sender to look for the CAs message to confirm that it's using a secure public key 
- In HTTPS, we continue to use symmetric cryptography to unlock messages locally (private key) but we exchange encrypted domains using assymetric cryptography to avoid man in the middle attacks 
    - We don't use asymmetric cryptography for everything because it's heavier 


## HTTP GET vs POST

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol is designed to enable communication between servers
- GET Method
    - GET requests can be cached so that you can let a client know that they are rerequesting information that hasn't updated
    - GET requests remain in the browser history
    - GET requests can be bookmarked
    - GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data, because data are stored as a part of the URL, which is cached in browser history
    - GET requests have length restrictions
    - GET requests should be used only to retrieve data, not update it 
- POST Method
    - POST requests are never cached
    - POST requests do not remain in the browser history
    - POST requests cannot be bookmarked
    - POST requests have no length restrictions

## RESTful Review

- RESTful API allows for GET, PUT, POST and DELETE methods
- Preferred to the more robuse Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) because it leverages less bandwidth, making it better for the internet 
    - REST is the bare minimum required for effective, failsafe communication between client and server
- RESTful calls are stateless: the performance of the application is not related to the execution of the request 
    - RESTful calls are independent of one another, and their impact is stored as a response in either the client or the server, but the call to action itself takes place at each machine locally; nothing of import happens over the transmission
- Stateless architecture makes REST great for the cloud, allowing for the failure of message transmission without catastrophic results 

## PUT vs PATCH

- PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under teh supplied URI
    - If something is already there, the new entity being sent should be considered the new entity stored at the URI
    - If nothing is there, this functions like a POST method at a specific (rather than a server-side defined) location 
- PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request be applied to the resource identified by the Request-URI
- PUT is idempotent, having the same results for the same input
- PUT can be dangerous if you aren't sure that you know all of the features of the entity that you want to replace
    - What if you forget certain field and overwrite them as undefined? 
- PATCH is alow idempotent, when updating existing resources
    - The risk with PATCH is that it can be non-idempotent if I attempt to patch to a too-general URI (like /users when I should be PATCHing to /users/1)
    - Without a specific resource to replace, PATCH will just add the requested data to the parent object, including a new ID, effectively creating duplicated data with a new ID

## Event Capturing, Bubbling 

- Bubbling principle is simple: for most events, once you find the specific target of the event, you call its event listener and then all event listeners in the chain of parent objects
    - Not all events bubble; focus is a notable exception
- event.target is the target that initiated the event bubble
    - event.currentTarget is the object where a clickhandler is stored, not necessarily item that was clicked, but the first available parent 
- two ways to prevent buddling:
    - event.stopPropogation() // turn off all parent handlers
    - event.stopImmediatePropogation() // turn of my handler and all parent handlers 
- Don't stop bubbling unless you have a specific reason for doing so
- Three phases of event management:
    - Capturing phase: starting from the body and moving to the event.target
    - Target phase: running listeners on event.target
    - Bubbling phase: running listeners on all ancestors of event.target
- The capture phase is normally invisible to us; it's rarely used for programming
    - To use the capturing phase, just add a second param 'true' to your element.addEvenListener() methods
- In the full process, code on event.target would be run twice (once during capturing, once during bubbling) if we just run code on every loop
- There's an event.eventPhase property that tells you the number of the phase when the element was caught, but this is rarely used
    - 0, not processed, 1, capturing, 2, target phase, 3, bubbling phase

## Redux Guide

- All state changes are explicit, so you can track all of them
- All changes are managed by a single object, called the state or the state tree
    - This tree is immutable; it cannot be mutated, only reassigned
- Action types will dispatch actions that hit specific case statements in our reducers switching on the action types 
    - Dispatching actions are the only way to change the application
    - Dispatched actions are POJOs that describe the minimum state change required for the new state 
- Pure vs. non-pure functions
    - Pure functions' output are 100% based on their input
    - Pure functions do not look to state outside of their own scope
    - Pure functions do not create side effect
    - Pure functions do not mutate the items passed to the function as a parameter
    - Non-pure functions could call the database, operate on the DOM, mutate what's passed to them, etc. 
    - Some of the actions that you write in Redux have to be pure
- Reducers receive an action and then return the new state of the application (either the entire state, or a slice of state specified by the reducer tree)
    - It has to be pure, so it has to return a new object
    - This will ensure the update to affiliated React components
- Redux store methods:
    - getState(): retrieves current state of the Redux store
    - dispatch(): dispatch actions to change the state via reducers
    - subscribe(): attach listeners to different React components, which will fire when the state changes
- Avoiding mutation in arrays
    - call deepFreeze(originalArray) to prevent accidental mutation
    - instead of push(), use concat()
    - You can also use the new spread operator: [...oldStateArr, newElement]
    - we can't use splice, becaues that's a mutating method
    - instead, to delete use [...oldStateArr.slice(0, index), ...oldStateArra.slice(index + 1)]
    - How do we replace a single element without mutating? 
        - Just like with the deletion, except that we concat the new item instead of just leaving it out 
- Avoiding mutation in objects
    - We can't just reassign the value on the object; that causes a mutation
    - We could just use a new object, but what if we forget one of the fields that weren't updated?
    - Use Object.assign({}, state, newState) which will retain the old data while ovewriting the new data in a new object (non-mutating)
