## Boot Process

- Power sends electricity to the motherboard
- Motherboard activates the read-only BIOS chip, that runs a test of all system hardware: videocard, CPU, RAM, peripherals
- When the BIOS tests are complete, control is handed over to the CPU

## Computer Hardware, Memory

- BIOS controls input from peripherals and passes them to the CPU
- CPU fetches instructions from memory and executes them, billions per second
- Instructions are managed by three kinds of boolean gates within transistors: AND gate, OR gate and NOT gates
- Boolean logic of gates are managed by the presence or absence of a charge running through an electron gate 
- Programs are executed in short term memory (RAM), but can be saved in a hard drive for permanent memory
- Dynamic RAM: each memory cell is composed of a transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges
    - Dynamic because it's constantly recharged to retain active memory
- Static RAM: six interlocted transistors that don't need to be refreshed
- RAM can only hold information for as long as it's given electricity to retain it
- With hard drive memory, latency is greater because you have to use a spinning disk to obtain stored information
    - Solid-state drives are faster and work by trapping electrical charges within floating gates
    - All more permanent memory strategies are liable to become weaker/degraded over time
