### CSS

## What is BEM?

- Block-Element-Modifier is a common pattern for naming CSS classes that allows you to have more extensible, readable code

## What's up with the data attribute?

- Allows us to store arbitary data in HTML tags, which we can access for DOM manipulation
- Data attribute is probably what's sitting behind the props/state architecture of Redux
- CSS also has access to this attribute, and it can perform regex searches for very precise styling patterns
