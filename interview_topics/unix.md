## Unix Intro

- operating system that sits under MacOS
    - kernel: allocates time and memory to programs and handles filestore and communications that respond to system requests
    - shell: privte interface between the user and kernel, accepting prompts from the user within the command line terminal
        - shell is an interpreter
        - bash is the name of the default MacOS shell
    - programs: programs are commands or larger sets of commands that the user requests the system to run via the shell
- everything in UNIX is either a file or a process (process is an executing program with a PID)
- file is a non-executing collection of data, created by processes running on the system
