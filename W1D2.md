## Adjacency List

- We saw that the spatial efficiency of an adjacency matrix was sub-bar, unless we have a very dense tree
- In the matrix, the cols are the ending  point, the rows are the starting point
- Consider this: if we are storing what nodes are connected, then we can deduce what nodes are not connected: we just check their absence from the list of present nodes 
- An adjacency list is therefore more space efficient because it doesn't demand space allocation for the absence of a value 
-We can store this list of connections with a variety of data structures: array, linked list, binary search tree 
-The linklist and tree will consume less space, but incrase lookup time if we need frequent random access
-Reminder: in an adjacency matrix for an undirected graph, we have a symmetric pattern of positive values (we can use this to cut memory in half)

| Type | Space | Time|
|------|------|------|
| adjacency matrix | O(v*v) | O(1) |
| adjacency list | O(v) | O(v)|

- In theory the list is less efficient at lookup, but following our assumption that we are building the list in response to our having a sparse graph, then lookup will very rarely deal with a O(v) lookup time 
- To find all adjacent nodes, we would have much faster lookup time with the adjacency list, because we wouldn't be scanning any redundant nodes
- To find whether two nodes are adjacent, we would have slightly faster lookup for the matrix (1 nano vs 10 milliseconds), but is this acceptable for most graphs? Yes
- What about a new value in our graph? If we were using arrays, this would be costly for the adjacency list 
- If we used linked lists, this would be great for the dynamism of new insertions and deletions, but we would have more trouble with lookup 

## CSS Grids (cont.)

### Grid components:
- Grid container: any container in your document
- Grid item: items in the list
- Grid line: lines in the grid
- Grid gap: space between the grid items
- Cell: space inside of the grid  gaps? 
### Tricks with Grid, and some Caveats 

- We can design the grid using the 'fr' fraction property 
- Grid items automatically populate from the top left to the bottom right
- You can define how many of the cells the specific components take on: e.g. 2/3 will take up the cells 2 and 3 in your grid
-Using gride-tempate-areas, you can define what goes where in your grid
-This allows for very responsive web design, because it's easier to move components around in the grid
- Grids are not inherited by child elements, we have to create nested grids if we want this effect
- Internet Explorer 10 and Edge lag behind, using the older Grid specification 
- You can use feature queries to test whether or not browsers accept grid 

### Practical Approach to CSS Grid Today
- Build mobile-accessible grid today
- Use mobile-first layout as a fallback for older browsers 
- Use Firefox for development because it has a grid inspector 
- Rachel Andrew's Grid by Example is the best resource for learning how to build with grid 
- CSS Trick has a guide to CSS Grid 

## Closures 

- combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared
- clsoure allows for private variable environments that have access to a public context 

```javascript 
const arr = [10, 12, 15, 21];
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  (function(j) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(`The value ${arr[j]} is at index: ${j}`);
    }, j * 1000);
  })(i)
}
```

- This uses an immediately-invoked function expression to retain the correct refernce to i (as j within the closure context) so that we print the correct information from within the scope
